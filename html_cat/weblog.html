        <h2>Truths programmers should know about case</h2>
        <p>A couple weeks ago I gave
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIebelIpdYk">a talk about usernames</a>at
          <a href="https://2018.northbaypython.org/">North Bay Python</a>. The content came mostly from things I&#8217;ve learned in roughly 12 years of maintaining
          <a href="/projects/django-registration/">django-registration</a>, which has taught me more than I ever wanted to know about how complex even &#8220;simple&#8221; things can&nbsp;be.</p>
        <p>I mentioned toward the beginning of the talk, though, that it wasn&#8217;t going to be one of those &#8220;falsehoods programmers believe about
          <em>X</em>&#8221; things. If you&#8217;re not familiar with those, you can just Google for &#8220;falsehoods programmers believe&#8221; and get a bunch ...</p>

        <h2>Core no more</h2>
        <p>If you&#8217;re not the sort of person who closely follows the internals of Django&#8217;s development, you might not know there&#8217;s
          <a href="https://github.com/django/deps/pull/47">a draft proposal</a>to drastically change the project&#8217;s governance. It&#8217;s been getting discussion on GitHub and mailing lists, but I want to take some time today to walk through and explain what this proposal does and what problems it&#8217;s trying to solve. So. Let&#8217;s dive&nbsp;in.</p>
        <h3>What&#8217;s wrong with&nbsp;Django?</h3>
        <p>Django the web framework is doing pretty well. It&#8217;s a stable, popular piece of software. Django the open-source project is
          <span class="caps">OK</span>right ...</p>

        <h2>django-registration 3.0</h2>
        <p>Today I&#8217;m pleased to announce the release of
          <a href="/projects/django-registration/">django-registration</a>3.0. This is a pretty big update, and one that&#8217;s been coming for a while, so I want to take a moment to go briefly through the changes (if you want the full version, you can check out
          <a href="https://django-registration.readthedocs.io/en/3.0/upgrade.html">the upgrade guide</a>in the&nbsp;documentation).</p>
        <p>This also marks the retirement of the 2.x release series of django-registration; 2.5.2 is on PyPI, and I intend for it to be the last 2.x release. The 2.x branch still exists ...</p>

        <h2>Checking if you&#39;re pwned (with Django)</h2>
        <p>Back in March I announced
          <a href="/weblog/2018/mar/06/two-new-projects/">the release of a couple security-related projects for Django</a>, one that implements the
          <code>Referrer-Policy</code>header, and one that uses
          <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords">the Pwned Passwords database</a>of
          <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned</a>to check users&#8217;&nbsp;passwords.</p>
        <p>Today I&#8217;ve bumped the version and rolled a new release of
          <a href="/projects/pwned-passwords-django/">pwned-passwords-django</a>; if you&#8217;re reading this, version 1.2 is on the Python Package Index, and is only a
          <code>pip install</code>away. And, of course,
          <a href="https://pwned-passwords-django.readthedocs.io/">there&#8217;s full documentation</a>available on how to use&nbsp;it.</p>
        <p>(
          <em>technically</em>, 1.2.1 is now the version on PyPI, because ...</p>

        <h2>Let&#39;s talk about packages</h2>
        <p>Recently the Python community got to celebrate the triumphant launch of
          <a href="https://pypi.org/">the new Python Package Index</a>. It&#8217;s been
          <a href="https://twitter.com/dstufft/status/985897799714770945">a long time coming</a>, and the folks who made it happen all deserve a round of&nbsp;applause.</p>
        <p>PyPI is an incredibly important piece of infrastructure for the Python community, and if you use Python you probably use PyPI, directly or indirectly, on a daily basis, and many different sites, services, and companies rely heavily on&nbsp;it.</p>
        <p>But: if you rely on PyPI, how often do you think about that reliance? What would you do ...</p>
